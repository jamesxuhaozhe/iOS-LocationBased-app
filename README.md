# iOS-LocationBased-app

iOS Learning

This is the iOS project that I have been following from iOS apprentice siries which are really awesome.
This is an location based app which can allow user to take a picture of the current location and store it along with 
user's current GPS location.

All the codes are from the book and I am in my way to become a iOS developer.
